# Batch burn SSDs and SDs

## sdm-gburn overview

sdm-gburn is a convenient way to burn a large number of SD cards for different users with different customizations from a single IMG. sdm-gburn's data file consists of one line per user, with all the configuration for that user:
```
username password=thepassword,option,option,...
```
username is always required. `password` is required unless `makeuser=no`. All other options are, er, optional.

Valid options:

* **password=*thepassword*** &mdash; The user's password
* **keymap=*km*** &mdash; Keymap for user. See `sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm --info keymap`
* **locale=*lc*** &mdash; Locale for user. See `sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm --info locale`
* **timezone=*tz*** &mdash; Timezone for user. See `sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm --info timezone`
* **wificountry=*thewificountry*** &mdash; WiFi country for user. See `sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm --info wifi`
* **wifiname=*wifidevname*** &mdash; WiFi device to configure. Defaults to `wlan0` if not provided.
* **wifissid=*wifissidforuser*** &mdash; WiFi SSID. If the SSID contains the dollar sign character ('$') you must use a .nmconnection file
* **wifipassword=*wifipasswordforuser*** &mdash; WiFi password. If the password contains the dollar sign character ('$') you must use a .nmconnection file.
* **hostname=*userhostname*** &mdash; Host name. Default: the username
* **makeuser=[yes|no]** &mdash; Add new user for given username/password. Default: **yes**
* **sudo=[yes|no]** &mdash; Enable sudo. Default: ***yes***
* **piwiz=[yes|no]** &mdash; Enable piwiz. Default: ***no***
* **autologin=[yes|no]** &mdash; Enable autologin. Default: ***no***
* **reboot=*n*** &mdash; Enable auto reboot at completion of sdm FirstBoot after waiting *n* seconds. Default: 20 seconds
* **mouse=*left*** &mdash; Set left-handed mouse for user. Default: right-handed mouse
* **nmconn=*/path/to/nmconnfile*** &mdash; Path to a single .nmconnection file. If multiple are needed, use `pluglist=@/path/to/plugin-list`
* **pluglist=*/path/to/pluglist*** &mdash; See <a href="Plugins.md">the Plugin documentation</a>

All options are provided on a single line, separated by commas. Although order is not important, the parsing is a bit primitive so the format and punctuation is strict. For example
```
bls   password=mysecret,wifissid=myssid,wifipassword=mywifisecret,autologin=yes,mouse=left,reboot=30
bls2  password=mysecret2,pluglist=/path/to/plugin-list
```
One way to minimize the amount of configuration per user is to set as many settings as possible that cover the most users when customizing the IMG.

For instance, if most users are in the same country, you would use `sdm --customize` and set keymap, locale, timezone, and wificountry to the appropriate settings for that country. Then, for those users located in other countries, configure them specifically in the sdm-gburn data file.

Of course, if there are applications or other configuration settings that you want in place for all users, include those in your `sdm --customize`.

See <a href="Hints-NetworkManager.md">Network Manager Hints</a> for details on creating .nmconnection files.
## Command line

```
sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm-gburn img-name data-file burn-device
```
* **img-name** is the name of the IMG that you want to burn. The IMG must be (at least minimally) customized by sdm. 
* **data-file** is the aforementioned data file in the format described above
* **burn-device** is the name of the device (e.g., /dev/sdX). It must not be mounted.

## Operation

sdm-gburn verifies that the files exist, and that the IMG is sdm-enhanced.

It then reads and processes the data-file and prompts you for each user, displaying the configuration information it found for the user as well:
```
p81/ssd/work$ sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm/sdm-gburn 2023-12-05-raspios-bookworm-arm64.img student3 /dev/sdc
Configuration read for user 'bls'
>  password=abc
>  autologin=no
>  reboot=20
>  mouse=left
Ready to burn '/dev/sdc' for user 'bls'? [YES/no/skip/quit/list/help]
```

Valid responses to the prompt:
```
Valid [case-insensitive] responses:
 Y - Burn the disk for user 'bls' (or press ENTER)
 N or S - Skip burning disk for user 'bls'
 Q - Do not burn the disk for user 'bls' and exit
 L - Display the generated plugins for 'bls'
 H - Print this help
Ready to burn '/dev/sdc' for user 'bls'? [YES/no/skip/quit/list/help]
```

## Examples

### Simple example (usernames and passwords)

Each disk has a different hostname (the customer's name in this case), but all have the same username/password.

/path/to/mypluglist has:
```
user:deluser=pi
user:adduser=bls|uid=2400|password=secret
```

/path/to/gburnlist has:
```
customer1 makeuser=no,pluglist=/path/to/mypluglist
customer2 makeuser=no,pluglist=/path/to/mypluglist
customer3 makeuser=no,pluglist=/path/to/mypluglist
```

Command line:
```
sudo /usr/local/sdm/sdm-gburn 2024-11-19-raspios-bookworm-arm64.img /path/to/gburnlist /dev/sdc
```
